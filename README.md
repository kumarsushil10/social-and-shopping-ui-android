# Social and E-commerce Templates
Check out the beautiful and colorful UI design implemented for a social and shopping app.
<br>
<br>
This app follows **[Material You](https://m3.material.io/develop/android/mdc-android)** guidelines, and most of the layouts are made using **[ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/constraintlayout/widget/ConstraintLayout)**. I used dummy data for lists and tabs, which you can easily customise.
